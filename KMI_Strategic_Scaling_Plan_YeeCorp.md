# KMI Sports Construction Strategic Scaling Plan
## Prepared by Matt Yee, YeeCorp

## Executive Summary

This strategic scaling plan has been prepared by YeeCorp for KMI Sports Construction, a Texas-based company specializing in the construction of athletic fields and sports facilities. KMI has grown primarily through word-of-mouth and an informal referral network of associates who earn commissions for bringing in clients. To scale operations nationally, KMI has identified an opportunity to target small U.S. towns with active municipal bonds allocated for athletic field repair or construction, particularly those near Division III (DIII), small Division II (DII), and NAIA schools.

This report presents comprehensive research findings, strategic recommendations, and a custom-built search tool to help KMI identify and prioritize target municipalities across the United States. Our analysis has identified 20 high-potential municipalities across four geographic regions that meet KMI's criteria, with a combined bond value exceeding $100 million specifically allocated for athletic facility construction or renovation.

## Research Methodology

Our research methodology involved a multi-step process:

1. **Municipal Bond Research**: We analyzed municipal bond databases and platforms to identify bonds specifically issued for sports facilities and athletic field construction within the past 1-3 years.

2. **Educational Institution Analysis**: We compiled comprehensive data on DIII, small DII, and NAIA schools across the United States, categorizing them by geographic region.

3. **Cross-Reference and Matching**: We matched towns with active bonds to nearby educational institutions, focusing on municipalities with populations under 100,000.

4. **Geographic Organization**: We organized the data into four geographic regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) to facilitate regional targeting strategies.

5. **Contact Information Verification**: We collected and verified contact information for relevant decision-makers, including athletic directors, facilities managers, and municipal officials.

## Key Findings
