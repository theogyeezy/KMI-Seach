# KMI Search Tool

## Overview
This repository contains the KMI Search Tool application, a custom-built solution designed to help KMI Sports Construction identify and target small U.S. towns with active municipal bonds for athletic facilities near DIII, DII, and NAIA schools.

**Prepared by Matt Yee, YeeCorp**

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visual representations of data distribution across regions, bond amounts, and athletic divisions
- **Detailed Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles for each target municipality
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Vite, React, Redux
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Data Visualization**: Custom charts and data visualization components

## Repository Structure
- `/app` - Search tool application code
- `/data` - Database schema and CSV data files
- `/graphics` - Visualizations and charts
- `/research` - Research findings and analysis

## Getting Started
