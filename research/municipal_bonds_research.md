# Municipal Bonds for Sports Facilities Research

## Overview
This document summarizes our initial research on municipal bonds for sports facilities, focusing on small towns with active bonds for athletic facilities, particularly those near DIII, small DII, and NAIA schools.

## Key Resources Explored

- Provides bond screening tools and trade history
- Example found: University of South Carolina Athletic Facilities bond (CUSIP: 914849FK5)
- Contains information on coupon rates, maturity dates, and trade history
- Premium access required for detailed research reports

### 3. Bond Buyer Articles

## Key Findings

1. **Financing Mechanisms**: Municipal bonds are a common financing tool for athletic facilities at educational institutions.

2. **Bond Types**: Several types of bonds are used for sports facilities:
   - Revenue bonds (backed by facility income)
   - General obligation bonds (backed by taxing authority)
   - Tax-exempt qualified private activity bonds (for 501(c)(3) organizations)

3. **Bond Details**: Athletic facility bonds typically include:
   - Coupon rates (e.g., 5.000% for USC Athletic Facilities)
   - Maturity dates (typically 15-30 years)
   - Trade history showing investor interest

4. **Challenges**: 
   - Limited public access to comprehensive bond databases
   - Difficulty filtering specifically for small town athletic facilities
   - Premium subscriptions required for detailed bond information

## Next Steps

The next phase of research will focus on:
1. Identifying DIII, small DII, and NAIA schools across the United States
2. Mapping these schools to small towns with populations under 100,000
3. Cross-referencing with municipal bond issuances for athletic facilities
4. Organizing findings by geographic regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)
